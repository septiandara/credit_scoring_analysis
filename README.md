This is a report for a bank’s loan division. We will look into whether customer’s various characteristics, such as marital status and number of children, have an impact on their default on loan. 

In this report, we focus on data preprocessing as there are many missing values and duplicates, as well as data categorisation and basic analysis.

This was made for Practicum by Yandex project on Data Preprocessing lesson.
